# Lightnings-vs-Elevation
The elevation as contributing factor to the formation of lightning strikes. - A study of lightning with focus on the elevation in global scale.

The data consisted of 20 years of observations (1995 - 2015) by the Lightning Imaging Sensor and elevations from the 90 m resolution Shuttle Radar Topography Mission for tropics and subtropics. I used K-means clustering to find different types of groups based on the FRD density and corresponding elevation. Then I performed hierarchical clustering to investigate the similarities in FRD density in a time series of monthly means over 20 years. Furthermore, I performed Principal Component Analysis, located and explored the top ten hot spots. In agreement with previous works, this analysis indicates a positive correlation between FRD and elevations at some areas up to a certain height. Moreover, there are indications that there are areas with high FRDs which are not correlated to elevation but rather to large scale atmospheric processes happening in these areas.
